  <h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <p>My name is Bridget and I am the owner of Taroteclipse. I am currently a graphic design student who has been reading tarot – for both myself and others – for years. I have always loved reading tarot, so in October 2020 I decided to create my small business. The positive feedback I have received is absolutely astonishing. I am grateful for all the love and support I have received, reading tarot truly is one of my greatest passions.</p>
